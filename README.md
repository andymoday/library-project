# library-project

This project was to make a library page, where books can be added to a visual 'library'. The brief required a button to mark the book read or not, and a pop up form to enter the details of a new book. The data is stored in a 'book' object in javascript, and retained in local storage so that the books do not disappear when the browser is refreshed.
